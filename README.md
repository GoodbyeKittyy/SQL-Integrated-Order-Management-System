## Description

This project was created using Microsoft Access and integrated with SQL. 

Inventory management is the supervision of a companyâ€™s inventory, including the processes for producing, ordering, storing, and selling products in the market. This includes managing the warehousing and processing of raw materials, components, and finished products.

Integrated with SQL inventory data, the system provides real-time visibility into product availability, stock levels, and location information. This ensures accurate order fulfillment and prevents stockouts or overstocking situations by automatically updating inventory levels upon order placement and fulfillment.
